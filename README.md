Udacity Front End Web Development - Project 1: Mockup to Article

## Synopsis

This is the very first project for Udacity's **Front End Web Development** course, through which I have been reviewing web fundamentals including HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.  For this project I was given a mockup and some plain text.  I needed to convert the plain text to HTML so that it matched the mockup exactly.  This project was added after I began the course, but I am now submitting it so that I have all projects marked as complete.  It was interesting doing this project last, since it is incredibly basic.  It is apparent that I've learned a lot about HTML, since it took me 5 minutes to complete without needing to search for anything.
